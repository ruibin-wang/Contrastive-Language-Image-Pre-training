# Contrastive-Language-Image-Pre-training


This work is based on the paper named "Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision", you can find the paper at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf 


the aim of this work is to test the pre-trained CLIP model and try the performance of Zero-shot Learning.
