# Contrastive-Language-Image-Pre-training


This work is based on the paper named "Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision", you can find the paper at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf 


the aim of this work is to test the pre-trained CLIP model and try the performance of Zero-shot Learning.

## Absract

State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple  e-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model  ransfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights athttps://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.

## Pseudocode

``` python
# image_encoder - ResNet or Vision Transformer 
# text_encoder - CBOW or Text Transformer 
# I[n, h, w, c] - minibatch of aligned images 
# T[n, l] - minibatch of aligned texts 
# W_i[d_i, d_e] - learned proj of image to embed 
# W_t[d_t, d_e] - learned proj of text to embed 
# t - learned temperature parameter 

# extract feature representations of each modality 

I_f = image_encoder(I) #[n, d_i] 
T_f = text_encoder(T)  #[n, d_t] 

# joint multimodal embedding [n, d_e] 
I_e = l2_normalize(np.dot(I_f, W_i), axis=1) 
T_e = l2_normalize(np.dot(T_f, W_t), axis=1) 

# scaled pairwise cosine similarities [n, n] 
logits = np.dot(I_e, T_e.T) * np.exp(t) 

# symmetric loss function 
labels = np.arange(n) 
loss_i = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=0) 
loss_t = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=1) 
loss = (loss_i + loss_t)/2
